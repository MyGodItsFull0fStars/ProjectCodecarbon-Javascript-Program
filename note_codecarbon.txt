conda create --name codecarbon
conda activate codecarbon
it's better to use the command conda install -c conda-forge codecarbon
Then codecarbon init
To start monitor use codecarbon monitor

Important: Don't change the experiment id in .codecarbon.config (you can find the file in your project file) Because if you change it there will be errors.

TODO: Find a way to get data from not Python programs.

Working:
Logger

Working, but:
Commet (https://www.comet.com/, mnist-comet.py, Tutorial: https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/comet.html): Only running with a python file and no measurring. The values are 0.

Not working:
Prometheus: not working because OfflineEmissionsTracker and EmissionsTracker don't have an argument called save_to_prometheus (You can see it clearly in the example prometheus_call.py from codecarbon)
Codecarbon Dashboard(https://dashboard.codecarbon.io/): It doesn't show my data. They have also written something about a bug at the end of the text from the CodeCarbon Api. (Example: api_call_demo.py)
Google Logger: There is a bug in the .exe
